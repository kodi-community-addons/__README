# Kodi Community Addons

As I'm no longer involved with Kodi I don't create or update any addons anymore.
My work is hereby donated to the community so I've setup up this Github organization where others can chime in and continue to use/improve my addons. Feel free to join if you want to contibute!

I'll help out with questions where I can / have time.

Cheers,

Marcel van der Veldt (marcelveldt)
